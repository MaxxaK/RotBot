# RotBot Discord Bot
My personal translator of brain rot I can never keep up with, RotBot is a Discord bot dictionary for slang.

Programmed in Java using the Java Discord API (JDA) and organized with Apache Maven, RotBot holds definitions of many current Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang that even I cannot remember. Users have the power to add definitions, delete definitions, ban words, translate words, and compete with each other through the "aura level" leaderboard (though to be honest I never actually fully got the leaderboard to work...).

RotBot was a ton of fun to make and I hope anyone who forks this can have some fun with it too...and maybe make a better profile picture for it.
